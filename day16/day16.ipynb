    "As you leave the cave and reach open waters, you receive a transmission from the Elves back on the ship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transmission was sent using the Buoyancy Interchange Transmission System (<span title=\"Just be glad it wasn't sent using the BuoyancY Transmission Encoding System.\">BITS</span>), a method of packing numeric expressions into a binary sequence. Your submarine's computer has saved the transmission in [hexadecimal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal) (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step of decoding the message is to convert the hexadecimal representation into binary. Each character of hexadecimal corresponds to four bits of binary data:\n",
    "\n",
    "    0 = 0000\n",
    "    1 = 0001\n",
    "    2 = 0010\n",
    "    3 = 0011\n",
    "    4 = 0100\n",
    "    5 = 0101\n",
    "    6 = 0110\n",
    "    7 = 0111\n",
    "    8 = 1000\n",
    "    9 = 1001\n",
    "    A = 1010\n",
    "    B = 1011\n",
    "    C = 1100\n",
    "    D = 1101\n",
    "    E = 1110\n",
    "    F = 1111\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "The BITS transmission contains a single _packet_ at its outermost layer which itself contains many other packets. The hexadecimal representation of this packet might encode a few extra `0` bits at the end; these are not part of the transmission and should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every packet begins with a standard header: the first three bits encode the packet _version_, and the next three bits encode the packet _type ID_. These two values are numbers; all numbers encoded in any packet are represented as binary with the most significant bit first. For example, a version encoded as the binary sequence `100` represents the number `4`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Packets with type ID `4` represent a _literal value_. Literal value packets encode a single binary number. To do this, the binary number is padded with leading zeroes until its length is a multiple of four bits, and then it is broken into groups of four bits. Each group is prefixed by a `1` bit except the last group, which is prefixed by a `0` bit. These groups of five bits immediately follow the packet header. For example, the hexadecimal string `D2FE28` becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "    110100101111111000101000\n",
    "    VVVTTTAAAAABBBBBCCCCC\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "Below each bit is a label indicating its purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   The three bits labeled `V` (`110`) are the packet version, `6`.\n",
    "*   The three bits labeled `T` (`100`) are the packet type ID, `4`, which means the packet is a literal value.\n",
    "*   The five bits labeled `A` (`10111`) start with a `1` (not the last group, keep reading) and contain the first four bits of the number, `0111`.\n",
    "*   The five bits labeled `B` (`11110`) start with a `1` (not the last group, keep reading) and contain four more bits of the number, `1110`.\n",
    "*   The five bits labeled `C` (`00101`) start with a `0` (last group, end of packet) and contain the last four bits of the number, `0101`.\n",
    "*   The three unlabeled `0` bits at the end are extra due to the hexadecimal representation and should be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, this packet represents a literal value with binary representation `011111100101`, which is `2021` in decimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every other type of packet (any packet with a type ID other than `4`) represent an _operator_ that performs some calculation on one or more sub-packets contained within. Right now, the specific operations aren't important; focus on parsing the hierarchy of sub-packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "An operator packet contains one or more packets. To indicate which subsequent binary data represents its sub-packets, an operator packet can use one of two modes indicated by the bit immediately after the packet header; this is called the _length type ID_:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   If the length type ID is `0`, then the next _15_ bits are a number that represents the _total length in bits_ of the sub-packets contained by this packet.\n",
    "*   If the length type ID is `1`, then the next _11_ bits are a number that represents the _number of sub-packets immediately contained_ by this packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, after the length type ID bit and the 15-bit or 11-bit field, the sub-packets appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here is an operator packet (hexadecimal string `38006F45291200`) with length type ID `0` that contains two sub-packets:\n",
    "\n",
    "    00111000000000000110111101000101001010010001001000000000\n",

    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "*   The three bits labeled `V` (`001`) are the packet version, `1`.\n",
    "*   The three bits labeled `T` (`110`) are the packet type ID, `6`, which means the packet is an operator.\n",
    "*   The bit labeled `I` (`0`) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 15-bit number representing the number of bits in the sub-packets.\n",
    "*   The 15 bits labeled `L` (`000000000011011`) contain the length of the sub-packets in bits, `27`.\n",
    "*   The 11 bits labeled `A` contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number `10`.\n",
    "*   The 16 bits labeled `B` contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number `20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading 11 and 16 bits of sub-packet data, the total length indicated in `L` (27) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, here is an operator packet (hexadecimal string `EE00D40C823060`) with length type ID `1` that contains three sub-packets:\n",
    "\n",

    "    VVVTTTILLLLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAABBBBBBBBBBBCCCCCCCCCCC\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "*   The three bits labeled `V` (`111`) are the packet version, `7`.\n",
    "*   The three bits labeled `T` (`011`) are the packet type ID, `3`, which means the packet is an operator.\n",
    "*   The bit labeled `I` (`1`) is the length type ID, which indicates that the length is a 11-bit number representing the number of sub-packets.\n",
    "*   The 11 bits labeled `L` (`00000000011`) contain the number of sub-packets, `3`.\n",
    "*   The 11 bits labeled `A` contain the first sub-packet, a literal value representing the number `1`.\n",
    "*   The 11 bits labeled `B` contain the second sub-packet, a literal value representing the number `2`.\n",
    "*   The 11 bits labeled `C` contain the third sub-packet, a literal value representing the number `3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading 3 complete sub-packets, the number of sub-packets indicated in `L` (3) is reached, and so parsing of this packet stops.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, parse the hierarchy of the packets throughout the transmission and _add up all of the version numbers_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few more examples of hexadecimal-encoded transmissions:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `8A004A801A8002F478` represents an operator packet (version 4) which contains an operator packet (version 1) which contains an operator packet (version 5) which contains a literal value (version 6); this packet has a version sum of _`16`_.\n",
    "*   `620080001611562C8802118E34` represents an operator packet (version 3) which contains two sub-packets; each sub-packet is an operator packet that contains two literal values. This packet has a version sum of _`12`_.\n",
    "*   `C0015000016115A2E0802F182340` has the same structure as the previous example, but the outermost packet uses a different length type ID. This packet has a version sum of _`23`_.\n",
    "*   `A0016C880162017C3686B18A3D4780` is an operator packet that contains an operator packet that contains an operator packet that contains five literal values; it has a version sum of _`31`_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decode the structure of your hexadecimal-encoded BITS transmission; _what do you get if you add up the version numbers in all packets?_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Part Two\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you have the structure of your transmission decoded, you can calculate the value of the expression it represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Literal values (type ID `4`) represent a single number as described above. The remaining type IDs are more interesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Packets with type ID `0` are _sum_ packets - their value is the sum of the values of their sub-packets. If they only have a single sub-packet, their value is the value of the sub-packet.\n",
    "*   Packets with type ID `1` are _product_ packets - their value is the result of multiplying together the values of their sub-packets. If they only have a single sub-packet, their value is the value of the sub-packet.\n",
    "*   Packets with type ID `2` are _minimum_ packets - their value is the minimum of the values of their sub-packets.\n",
    "*   Packets with type ID `3` are _maximum_ packets - their value is the maximum of the values of their sub-packets.\n",
    "*   Packets with type ID `5` are _greater than_ packets - their value is _1_ if the value of the first sub-packet is greater than the value of the second sub-packet; otherwise, their value is _0_. These packets always have exactly two sub-packets.\n",
    "*   Packets with type ID `6` are _less than_ packets - their value is _1_ if the value of the first sub-packet is less than the value of the second sub-packet; otherwise, their value is _0_. These packets always have exactly two sub-packets.\n",
    "*   Packets with type ID `7` are _equal to_ packets - their value is _1_ if the value of the first sub-packet is equal to the value of the second sub-packet; otherwise, their value is _0_. These packets always have exactly two sub-packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these rules, you can now work out the value of the outermost packet in your BITS transmission.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   `C200B40A82` finds the sum of `1` and `2`, resulting in the value _`3`_.\n",
    "*   `04005AC33890` finds the product of `6` and `9`, resulting in the value _`54`_.\n",
    "*   `880086C3E88112` finds the minimum of `7`, `8`, and `9`, resulting in the value _`7`_.\n",
    "*   `CE00C43D881120` finds the maximum of `7`, `8`, and `9`, resulting in the value _`9`_.\n",
    "*   `D8005AC2A8F0` produces `1`, because `5` is less than `15`.\n",
    "*   `F600BC2D8F` produces `0`, because `5` is not greater than `15`.\n",
    "*   `9C005AC2F8F0` produces `0`, because `5` is not equal to `15`.\n",
    "*   `9C0141080250320F1802104A08` produces `1`, because `1` + `3` = `2` \\* `2`.\n",
